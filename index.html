          The wave is probably one of the most difficult shapes to make in CSS.
          We always try to approximate it with properties like border-radius and
          lots of magic numbers until we get something that feels kinda close.
          And that’s before we even get into wavy patterns, which are more
          difficult. “SVG it!” you might say, and you are probably right that
          it’s a better way to go. But we will see that CSS can make nice waves
          and the code for it doesn’t have to be all crazy. This is an example
          of a section with a wavy border at the bottom. Here you can see how
          the border can be styled to create an interesting visual effect.
