# Wavy Border Section Practice

This project demonstrates the implementation of smooth, organic wavy borders at the top and bottom of a section. It features a simple "About Me" section with SVG-based waves that overflow the container for a visually pleasing, modern design effect.
The `about` section of this project is styled with two SVG wave shapes, creating a seamless, organic transition between sections.

## Features

- **Top and Bottom Waves**: Smooth SVG wave borders positioned at the top and bottom of the section.
- **Responsive Design**: The waves adjust their size and appearance across various screen sizes, ensuring the design looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Overflow Control**: The waves extend beyond the sectionâ€™s width to avoid visual cutoffs, ensuring a smooth, full-width experience.
- **Customizable**: You can easily adjust the wave shapes and colors to match your design needs.
